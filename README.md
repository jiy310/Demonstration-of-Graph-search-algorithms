## Demonstration-of-Graph-search-algorithms:

As we known, popular graph search algorithms are DFS, BFS, Dijkstra and A*.

For this program, it simply implements all of these four algorithms and further demonstrates each specialities.

For DFS and BFS, they are used to find shortest path in an undirected graph. 

On the contrary, for Dijkstra and A*, they are mainly focused on solving shortest path question in a directed graph.

Note that for A*, we use a herustic function to find a "fairly" good path between start and end point. 

Compare to the normal Dijkstra, it runs faster but not neccessarily return the best result.
